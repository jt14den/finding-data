Motivating Quotes: 

>Computing is now an integral part of every aspect of science, but most scientists are never taught how to build, use, validate, and share software well. 
>>Software Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org/>

>Data is the central currency of science, but the nature of scientific data has changed dramatically with the rapid pace of technology. This change has led to the development of a wide variety of data formats, dataset sizes, data complexity, data use cases, and data sharing practices. 
>>Hart EM, Barmby P, LeBauer D, Michonneau F, Mount S, et al. (2016) Ten Simple Rules for Digital Data Storage. PLoS Comput Biol 12(10): e1005097. doi: [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097)

* How do we respond as libraries and librarians? 
* The fact that research is more and more computationally enabled -- some are claiming that computational thinking is integral to solving problems and understanding human behavior
* And knowing how to create software and use/manage research data are foundational skills set for being able to create knowledge. 
* We are going to share what we have done at UCSD in the past year to support researchers facing this reality.

## At UCSD This is Borne Out by emerging "Data Science" topics in the Curriculum

In the past 5 years we’ve witnessed the emergence of data science as a field of study as programs and in the larger curriculum:

* Jacobs Engineering MS in DS (fall 2014)
* MBA in Analytics program starting in fall quarter 2016
* Data science student society - self-organized undergrad group 
* Courses on “big data’ in our global policy school
* Focus on computational sociology for Sociology Grads 
* Undergrad major in Data Science also in the works as part of CogSci and Jacobs Engineering 
* Bioinformatics Program, Med Informatics 
* Other departments with interests in genomics that cuts across the biological sciences 

---

## Novel Research Environments 

* Driving this study in Data Science is the need to deal with the huge amounts of data either acquired via new sources:  (sensor/social media) or generated by analysis.  
* Researchers also need technology and storage to deal, process and analyze the data. 
* Note data for many researched is also becoming more heterogeneous -- so facility with data manipulation is a core skill. 
* Working in or building data pipelines also an emerging need. 

---

## DATA SOURCES

* Data are becoming both high dimensional and volume
* Public web is external
* Social media data 
* machine log data through your Web analytics
* Sensor data - from cell phones, etc. high volume 
* Mention open data movement 

---

##TECHNIQUES 

* Researchers often are now required to learn how to deal with ‘big data’
* Use data mining and text mining techniques - how to prepare text for analysis, etc.
* Social networking - drawing inference from interconnected data - grouping, clustoring, etc.
* ML algorithms to draw out knowledge form high diminsional/high vol. Data 
* Focus on RR to promote transparency in science and replicate findings 

---

## New Research Depends on Basic CS Skills

* Students need software and data skills before fully engaging in novel research with novel data sources.
* Entry level researchers now understand they need to do things like text & data mining or machine learning, but typically haven’t had training in coding or working with lots of heterogeneous and untidy data
* They have to learn R and working with data/ inferential statistics before they can do regression and then practical ML
* We could start with python as the base language (maybe that is preferred in their dept. And higher order tools) and it still would hold 
* The take away for us is that to engage in higher order analysis student will need to a) learn to code and b) acquire, work and analyze data in a disciplined best practice way
* This motivated us to target these ‘entry-level’ skills in our workshops

---

## How we are responding at UC San Diego

1. Offering data workshops
2. Partnering with the Software Carpentry Foundation
3. Building up consulting spaces with appropriate computing and staff with specialized skills
5. Engaging with researchers, partnering with campus stakeholders, and building data communities

---

## 1. Data Workshops

* Cover computational Basics
* Focused on providing high-impact novice lessons for the following topics:
  * Learing to code - software development best practices
  * Working with data (data cleaning) and data management best practices
  * Exploratory data analysis in some domain space 
* Where possible, we used Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry as a primary resource for lessons materials
* These are high quality lesson materials that are cloud sourced by 1000s of qualified instructors and freely reusable under CC BY 4.0

---

## 2. Partnering with Software Carpentry

* We realized we need to have a larger pool of qualified instructors on campus to teach
* We needed a way to develop our own skills as instuctors as well
* We wanted to be part of a community that provided high quality instructional materials
* So, we affiliated as a Silver Partner with the Software Capentry 
* Earlier in 2016 3 Library Staff became certified software carpentry instructors
* As part of our partnership we have a cohort of 6 instructors going thru SWC instructor training in December - these instructors come from the Library, SIO, SDSC, Political Science
* Our model is to build stakeholdership on campus, e.g. our School of Global Policy and Strategy has given us $5K for next year's partnership
* SWC instruction requires core pedagogical concepts and evidence based teaching practices.

### Workshops We've Offered 

### One Shot Workshops and Boot Camps

* Once our goals were in place we began scheduling a series of workshops for R and Python. 
* We hope to develop a core set of one-shot workshops in R & Python

### Disciplined Based Data Instruction 

**School of Global Policy and Strategy**: 
* Winter 2016, 9 week skills course series in R, Python, SQL, and data management 101
* Total enrollment: 122 GPS masters students
* We gave out 93 certificates of proficiency

In this example the library data services programs have started to work with campus departments and subject experts to provide more domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. 

**R for Genomics**:
* Teamed with bioinformatics librarians to teach a R 3 course series 
* Courses included working with, managing and visualizing genomics data in R
* Total enrollment: 90 participants from various departments (SIO, Bioinformatics, Biology, Salk, Molecular Biology)

**Python for Economics Department**
* 3 week Python series
* 20 Ph.D. candidates
* Courses included an introduction to Python, working with data in Python and working with web data in code

---

#### Carpentry Workshops

* Typically are offered as 2-day bootcamp style workshops
* Since 10/2015 we've offerec 3 2-day SWC workshops 
  * Once we have more instructors on campus and in departments, we want to increase the frequency of these workshops
  * Presents a challenge for us organizationally 
* Offered the first Library Carpentry workshop in the USA
* Technologies taught included using open lessons for Python, R, UNIX Shell, Git, OpenRefine

## 3. Consulting Service & Space  

* Data Services including computing and consulting has been a part of the UCSD Libraries since 1985
* In the 2000s focused on GIS -- providing access to ArcGIS and specialists
* Currently finishing a refresh of the service to align more with the emergent data science skills and importance of working with heterogeneous data 
* We've found that after teaching workshops, researchers will hear about you and having an easy way to work with you is important
* We are explicitly designed the lab to support data intensive work in a studio model: 
    - support data users as creators, learners, and collaborators
    - provide staff with specialized skills in data & GIS
    - support mobile computing and provide higher end computing 
    - provide exertise on software development skills (best practices)

---

### Consulting includes: 

* Data Management
* Software development
* Metadata consulting
* Working with geospatial data
* Help identify, locate and acquire data in all formats
* Support for software tools
* Assist with cleaning data and preparing data for analysis

---

## 4. Increased engagement with researchers and their research

* With ressearch IT, initiating [The Hacker Within](http://www.thehackerwithin.org/) in Winter 2017
* What is [The Hacker Within](http://www.thehackerwithin.org/)
    * gatherings for reseachers to share skills and best practices for scientific computation.
    * open sessions with peers at all levels of experience
    * sharing topics useful or related to scientific computing
* Format of event
* Main topic presentations - workshops, demonstration, presentations
* Lightning talks
